CS450 Homework 3


This program contains six files - Point3.h, Vector3.h, mesh.h, Lab-modeling.h, mesh.cpp and Lab-modeling.cpp.

The program lets the user to input vertices and then generate a surface of revolution from a polyline profile.

The program can read the file and generate the mash based on the data of the file.

The program can write the mash data to a file.


Restriction:

User needs to input the vertices from top to bottom to generate a counter-clock-wise traverse order.


To run the program, simply run the Lab-modeling.cpp directly.


Extra part:

To read the file, press r key and then type the filename to the command line. The object will be displaied on the window.

To write the file, press w key and then type the filename to the command line. The file will be saved in the current 
project folder.
